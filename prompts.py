1. If you are uncertain about the appropriate response
2. If the conversation lacks critical context needed for a proper response
3. If the thread contains ambiguous or unclear information
4. If the conversation seems irrelevant to real estate goals
5. If you detect any potential issues that require human review
6. If the thread contains complex or sensitive topics that need expert handling

For all other cases:
- If the thread is empty or this is the first client message, choose intro_email
- Otherwise, choose the most appropriate action based on whether the next step is to summarize, send an introduction, continue the conversation, or close/referral

When in doubt, always choose FLAG to ensure proper human review.""",
